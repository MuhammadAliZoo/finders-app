## üöß Current Implementation Challenges

### Firebase Integration Issues

- Firebase native modules (`@react-native-firebase/*`) compatibility issues with Expo Go
- Version conflicts between Firebase packages (current version 18.7.3) and other dependencies
- Need to implement custom development client for native Firebase functionality
- Configuration issues with `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist`

### Expo Configuration Challenges

- Conflicts between Expo managed workflow and native module requirements
- Navigation types need updates to include new screens (e.g., FirebaseTest screen)
- Issues with Expo prebuild process when including native modules
- Environment variable loading errors affecting configuration

### Development Environment Setup

- Native module integration requiring custom development client
- Build process failing due to plugin configuration errors
- Package version mismatches between Expo SDK 52 and React Native dependencies
- Pod installation issues in iOS development environment

### Potential Solutions Being Explored

1. **Firebase Integration**

   - Consider switching to Expo's Firebase SDK
   - Implement proper version management for Firebase packages
   - Complete native module setup with development client

2. **Expo Configuration**

   - Update navigation types and configurations
   - Resolve prebuild process issues
   - Implement proper environment variable handling

3. **Development Setup**
   - Configure proper development client setup
   - Resolve pod installation issues
   - Align package versions with Expo SDK requirements

### Next Steps

1. Resolve Firebase configuration issues
2. Complete native module setup
3. Fix navigation type definitions
4. Implement proper environment variable handling
5. Resolve pod installation and build process issues
